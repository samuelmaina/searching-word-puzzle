# searching_word_puzzle_in_c++
A c++ program to read  a word puzzle(from a file)  and the words to be searched(from a file)   and then print the search result to the console.
The program prints whether a word was found or not. If the word was found , it prints the row and column where the first letter of the word was found in the search grid, if not the program prints not found.
The program searches to the left, right, up, down, north-west, north-east, south-west and south-east direction  for the remaining letters of a word if the first letter of a word is found.
There is no use of the string matching methods such as find(), all the searching methods are created from scratch
